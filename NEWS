Wrap hue in HSV, HSL, HCY. Fix black pullout in non ICC CMYK
conversion. Added AV2 gamme u8->linear float conversions.  VAPI file generation
for vala integration. Adjusted strategy for conversion selection, trades back
warm-up time for missing some fast multi-step conversions. 
                                                                    </dd><dt>

Optimizations for many format conversions for u8, u16 and half formats. And
fixed a crash for NANs in float to u8 conversions.
                                                                    </dd><dt>

Added Yu'v' (CIE 1976 UCS) color model.  Fixed a severe non-initialised memory
issue - that kept us from using fast paths for many babl spaces loaded from
profile. More fully symmetric conversions between associated and separate
alpha. Added more converters, both SSE2 and non-SSE2 for matrix-conversion
between different RGB spaces.  Improvements to website/documentation; babl is
now using the terms associated alpha and separate alpha, all of:
nonpremultiplied-, premultiplied- and nonassociated- alpha are now considered
deprecated API. HCY luminance is now relative to the RGB space used - no change
for sRGB related pixel formats. AVX2 acceleration for some linear to float
conversions.
                                                                    </dd><dt>

Added API call, babl_space_get_rgb_luminance,
Make most SIMD code-paths optional again on i686.
                                                                    </dd><dt>

Support for Hygon Dhyana, and Y~aA formats for symmetric completeness.
Code consistency, gitlab CI, autotools and meson build improvements.

                                                                    </dd><dt>

Continuous integration with gitlab.
Initial CMYK spaces with lcms2 based ICC support, much room for optimization.
Improved custom space support for palette formats.
scRGB space, works like sRGB but always with linear TRCs.
Model introspection API permitting low overhead checks whether a format/model
is RGB, CMYK type of alpha and similar.
                                                                    </dd><dt>
