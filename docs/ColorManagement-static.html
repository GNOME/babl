  <h2>Color Management</h2>

  <p>By default the babl API is assuming data to be (unbounded) sRGB data, data
  being sRGB defines the conversion to and from gray-scale as well as the gamma
  - or Transfer Response Curve, TRC, used for converting between linear and
  non-linear variants of the data.
  </p>

  <p>babl has API for creating a format for a specific space:
  <tt>babl_format_with_space("R'G'B' u16", babl_space ("Rec2020"))</tt> creates
  a 16 bit integer format for the Rec2020 color space. Babl knows internally
  about "sRGB", "Rec2020", "Adobe", "Apple" and "ProPhoto" spaces, as they are
  defined with constants on their wikipedia pages.
  </p>

  <p>Additional spaces can be loaded from monitor-class matrix+TRC ICC v2 and
  v4 profiles. Using babl_icc_make_space (see babl.h for details). The space of
  a babl format can also be queried with babl_format_get_space.
  </p>

  <p>The conversions babl does with ICC profiles are according to what is known
  as the relative-colorimetric intent, monitor profiles containing both the
  matrices used by babl and 3d CLUTs (color look up tables) sometimes also do
  relative-colorimetric transfer for the "perceptual" intent CLUTs, but with
  a more flexible and possibly higher accuracy conversions.</p>
