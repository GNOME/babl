<h2>TODO</h2>

<p>These are among desired or expected changes to babl, that are missing.</p>

<ul>
  <li>extensions for many SIMD variants for many archiectures.</li>
  <li>Spectral pixel formats - with configurable spectral mapping to tristimulus with configurable illuminant + observer</li>
  <li>Spectral substrate + ink/paint job configuration as a pixel format,
combined with above to achieve soft proofing, and stochastic sparse LUT for
separation.</li>
  <li>Support for datatypes that are not a multiple of 8bit.</li>
</ul>
